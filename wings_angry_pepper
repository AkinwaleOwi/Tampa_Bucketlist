Signature Sauces/Styles:
Mild (Whimpy): Classic, easy-going buffalo.
Medium (At least you tried): A step up from mild.
Angry (Yu da man!): Their signature spicy Southern-style sauce.
Sweet and Nasty: Starts sweet, ends with a kick (a "kiss" then a "slap").
Angry Garlic: Sweet, spicy, with a heavy garlic punch.
Angry BBQ: Sweet & tangy with an "angry" kick.
Tropical Heat: A fruity, spicy option.
Carolina Boner Sauce: A spicy take on Carolina BBQ. 
Wing Preparation:
They often smoke their wings for hours before finishing them in the fryer for extra crispiness. 
To find them: Look for locations in Seminole or Madeira Beach, FL, and check their online menus on Angry Pepper Smokehouse or Angry Pepper Taphouse for the full "Angry Meter" options.
