### 📝 Notes

* Many juices come in both **fresh (with ice)** and **cold-pressed** versions — cold-pressed tends to retain more nutrients due to lower oxidation. ([Xtreme Juice Smoothies & Juices Tampa][1])
* This menu focuses on **juices only**; if they offer smoothies or additional items, those may be on a separate page or seasonal listing not shown on the current online juice menu. ([Xtreme Juice Smoothies & Juices Tampa][1])
* Xtreme Juice emphasizes **fresh, non-pasteurized ingredients** in its juice blends. ([Xtreme Juice Smoothies & Juices Tampa][1])
